## Basic Concepts

### What is Node.js and how does it work?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code.

### What are the differences between Node.js and traditional web server models?

Traditional web servers use a multi-threaded approach to handle concurrent requests, creating a new thread for each request. Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop with non-blocking I/O operations, which allows it to handle many requests simultaneously without the overhead of creating multiple threads.

### Explain the event loop in Node.js.

The event loop is the core of Node.js's asynchronous behavior. It continuously checks for pending tasks, I/O operations, and timers, executing callbacks as needed. When a task completes, its callback is pushed to the event queue, and the event loop picks it up and executes it.

### What are the advantages of using Node.js?

Some advantages include:

- High performance due to non-blocking I/O and V8 engine.
- Ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections with high throughput.
- Single programming language for both client-side and server-side code.
- Large and active community with a wealth of libraries and frameworks.

## Advanced Concepts

### Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware can execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.

### How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?

Node.js handles asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. The event loop plays a crucial role in managing asynchronous tasks, allowing non-blocking execution and handling multiple operations concurrently.

### What are streams in Node.js and how do they work?

Streams are objects that enable reading or writing data piece-by-piece. They are used to handle large data sets efficiently. There are four types of streams in Node.js: readable, writable, duplex (both readable and writable), and transform (modifies the data as it is written and read). Streams use an event-based API to process data incrementally.

### What are buffers in Node.js?

Buffers are used to handle binary data in Node.js. They are instances of the Buffer class and are used to work with raw binary data directly. Buffers can be allocated and manipulated, allowing developers to handle binary data efficiently.

## Practical Questions

### How would you handle error management in a Node.js application?

Error management can be handled using try-catch blocks for synchronous code and promise.catch or async/await with try-catch for asynchronous code. Centralized error handling middleware can also be used in Express applications to catch and handle errors in a unified way.

### Write a simple Node.js server using the http module.

```javascript
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
  res.end("Hello, World!\n");
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### How would you implement a basic REST API in Node.js using Express?

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

app.get("/api/items", (req, res) => {
  res.send("GET request to the homepage");
});

app.post("/api/items", (req, res) => {
  res.send("POST request to the homepage");
});

app.put("/api/items/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`PUT request to item with id ${req.params.id}`);
});

app.delete("/api/items/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`DELETE request to item with id ${req.params.id}`);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Write a function in Node.js to read a file asynchronously.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

function readFileAsync(path) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fs.readFile(path, "utf8", (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(err);
      } else {
        resolve(data);
      }
    });
  });
}

readFileAsync("./example.txt")
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

## Situation-Based Questions

### 1. How would you handle high traffic on your Node.js server?

To handle high traffic, I would:

- Use load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.
- Implement clustering to take advantage of multi-core systems.
- Optimize code and use efficient algorithms.
- Use caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached to reduce database load.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

### 2. How would you secure a Node.js application?

To secure a Node.js application, I would:

- Use environment variables for sensitive data.
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities.
- Use security headers to protect against common attacks.

### 3. What would you do if you encounter a memory leak in your Node.js application?

To address a memory leak, I would:

- Use tools like Node.js's built-in heap profiler or external tools like `node-inspect` or `clinic` to identify memory leaks.
- Analyze heap snapshots to find objects that should have been garbage collected.
- Review code for common causes of memory leaks, such as:
  - Retaining references to objects
  - Excessive use of global variables
  - Incorrect event listener management
- Optimize code and refactor problematic areas to ensure proper memory management.

These questions and answers cover a range of topics, from basic concepts to advanced scenarios and practical coding tasks, providing a comprehensive evaluation of a candidate's knowledge and skills in Node.js.

Here's the content converted to a Markdown (.md) file format, adding it to the previous section:

## In-depth Questions

### Explain the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate().

`process.nextTick()` schedules a callback to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, before any I/O operations. `setImmediate()`, on the other hand, schedules a callback to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop, but after I/O events. Essentially, `process.nextTick()` is executed sooner than `setImmediate()`.

### What are the differences between require() and import in Node.js?

`require()` is used in CommonJS modules, which is synchronous and can be used anywhere in the code. `import` is used in ES6 modules, which is asynchronous and must be at the top level of the file. `import` supports static analysis and tree-shaking, whereas `require()` does not.

### How do you handle asynchronous errors in Node.js?

Asynchronous errors in Node.js can be handled using:

- Callbacks: Pass an error as the first argument.
- Promises: Use `.catch()` method to handle errors.
- Async/await: Use try-catch blocks to handle errors.

### Describe the cluster module in Node.js and its use cases.

The cluster module allows you to create child processes (workers) that share the same server port. It helps in taking advantage of multi-core systems, enabling Node.js applications to handle more concurrent connections by distributing the load among multiple processes.

## Practical and Situational Questions

### How would you implement session management in a Node.js application?

Session management can be implemented using libraries like express-session. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const session = require("express-session");

const app = express();
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "your secret key",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
    cookie: { secure: false }, // Set to true if using HTTPS
  })
);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.views) {
    req.session.views++;
    res.send(`Number of views: ${req.session.views}`);
  } else {
    req.session.views = 1;
    res.send("Welcome to the session demo. Refresh!");
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

### Write a function to create and manage a worker pool in Node.js.

```javascript
const {
  Worker,
  isMainThread,
  parentPort,
  workerData,
} = require("worker_threads");

if (isMainThread) {
  // Main thread logic
  const workers = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    workers.push(new Worker(__filename, { workerData: { workerId: i } }));
  }
  workers.forEach((worker) => {
    worker.on("message", (message) =>
      console.log(`Worker ${message.workerId} finished`)
    );
    worker.on("error", (error) => console.error(`Worker error: ${error}`));
    worker.on("exit", (code) => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        console.error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`);
      }
    });
  });
} else {
  // Worker thread logic
  const { workerId } = workerData;
  // Perform some task
  setTimeout(() => {
    parentPort.postMessage({ workerId });
  }, 1000);
}
```

### Describe how you would optimize a Node.js application for performance.

To optimize a Node.js application for performance:

- Use clustering to take advantage of multi-core processors.
- Implement caching using tools like Redis or Memcached.
- Optimize database queries and use indexes where appropriate.
- Use asynchronous programming techniques to avoid blocking the event loop.
- Minimize the use of synchronous operations.
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets.
- Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly.
- Profile and monitor the application using tools like clinic, node-inspect, or pm2.

## 8. Advanced Topics

### What is EventEmitter in Node.js? Explain how it works with an example.

EventEmitter is a class in Node.js that allows objects to emit named events and register listeners for those events. It is used to handle custom events in applications.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require("events");
class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

myEmitter.on("event", () => {
  console.log("An event occurred!");
});

myEmitter.emit("event"); // Output: An event occurred!
```

### Explain how Node.js manages dependencies and version control using npm.

Node.js uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage project dependencies. Developers specify dependencies in the package.json file, which includes the package name and version. npm allows for version control by specifying version ranges, and it helps in installing, updating, and managing these dependencies.

### How would you handle file uploads in a Node.js application?

File uploads can be handled using middleware like multer in an Express application.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const multer = require("multer");
const upload = multer({ dest: "uploads/" });

const app = express();

app.post("/upload", upload.single("file"), (req, res) => {
  res.send("File uploaded successfully");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

### What is the purpose of the path module in Node.js, and how would you use it?

The path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It can be used to handle and transform file paths in a platform-independent way.

```javascript
const path = require("path");

const directory = "users";
const filename = "file.txt";

const fullPath = path.join(directory, filename);
console.log(fullPath); // Output: users/file.txt

const ext = path.extname(fullPath);
console.log(ext); // Output: .txt
```

## 9. Deep Dive into Specific Topics

### Describe the difference between fs.readFile() and fs.createReadStream(). When would you use one over the other?

`fs.readFile()` reads the entire file into memory before returning it, which is suitable for small files. `fs.createReadStream()` reads the file in chunks and streams it, which is more efficient for large files and avoids high memory usage.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Using fs.readFile
fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});

// Using fs.createReadStream
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt", "utf8");
readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk);
});
```

### How does Node.js handle HTTPS requests?

Node.js handles HTTPS requests using the https module. You need an SSL certificate and private key to set up an HTTPS server.

```javascript
const https = require("https");
const fs = require("fs");

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync("key.pem"),
  cert: fs.readFileSync("cert.pem"),
};

https
  .createServer(options, (req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end("Hello Secure World!");
  })
  .listen(3000);
```

### Explain how you would handle rate limiting in a Node.js application.

Rate limiting can be implemented using middleware such as express-rate-limit.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const app = express();

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use(limiter);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

Unit tests in Node.js can be written using frameworks like Mocha, Jest, or Jasmine. Here's an example using Mocha and Chai:

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

describe("Sum Function", () => {
  it("should return the sum of two numbers", () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).to.equal(3);
  });
});
```

### How do you debug a Node.js application?

Debugging can be done using the built-in debugger, node inspect, or using IDEs like VS Code with their debugging tools. You can also use console.log() for simple debugging.

```sh
node inspect app.js
```

### What are some common issues you have encountered when working with Node.js, and how did you resolve them?

Common issues include callback hell, memory leaks, and unhandled promise rejections. Solutions involve using Promises and async/await to avoid callback hell, profiling memory usage to identify leaks, and adding proper error handling for promises.

## 12. Security

### How do you handle authentication and authorization in a Node.js application?

Authentication can be handled using libraries like passport or jsonwebtoken for JWT-based authentication. Authorization can be implemented through middleware that checks user roles and permissions.

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const secretKey = "your-secret-key";

// Generate a token
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123 }, secretKey);

// Middleware to verify token
const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers["authorization"];
  if (!token) return res.status(403).send("No token provided.");
  jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) return res.status(500).send("Failed to authenticate token.");
    req.userId = decoded.userId;
    next();
  });
};

app.get("/protected", authenticate, (req, res) => {
  res.send("This is a protected route.");
});
```

### How do you prevent SQL injection in a Node.js application?

Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries that handle escaping inputs automatically. For example, using mysql:

```javascript
const mysql = require("mysql");
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  /* config */
});

const userId = "some-user-id";
connection.query(
  "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
  [userId],
  (error, results) => {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log(results);
  }
);
```

### How would you protect a Node.js application from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks?

Sanitize user inputs, use templating engines that automatically escape output, set security headers, and use libraries like helmet to set HTTP headers.

```javascript
const helmet = require("helmet");
app.use(helmet());

const escapeHtml = (unsafe) => {
  return unsafe
    .replace(/&/g, "&amp;")
    .replace(/</g, "&lt;")
    .replace(/>/g, "&gt;")
    .replace(/"/g, "&quot;")
    .replace(/'/g, "&#039;");
};

app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
  const safeInput = escapeHtml(req.body.input);
  // Process the safe input
});
```

## 13. Database Interaction

### How do you connect to a MongoDB database in a Node.js application?

Use the mongoose library to connect and interact with MongoDB.

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);

const newUser = new User({ name: "Alice", age: 30 });
newUser.save().then(() => console.log("User saved."));
```

### How would you handle transactions in Node.js with a relational database like PostgreSQL?

Use a library like pg or an ORM like Sequelize to handle transactions.

```javascript
const { Client } = require("pg");
const client = new Client({
  /* config */
});
await client.connect();

try {
  await client.query("BEGIN");
  const res1 = await client.query(
    "INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES($1) RETURNING id",
    ["Alice"]
  );
  const userId = res1.rows[0].id;
  await client.query("INSERT INTO orders(user_id, product) VALUES($1, $2)", [
    userId,
    "Book",
  ]);
  await client.query("COMMIT");
} catch (e) {
  await client.query("ROLLBACK");
  throw e;
} finally {
  await client.end();
}
```

## 14. Performance Optimization

### How do you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in a Node.js application?

Use profiling tools like clinic, node-inspect, or pm2 to identify bottlenecks. Analyze the performance metrics and refactor the code to optimize slow parts. Common solutions include using caching, optimizing database queries, and avoiding blocking operations.

### Explain the role of reverse proxies in scaling Node.js applications.

Reverse proxies like Nginx or HAProxy can distribute incoming traffic across multiple server instances, handle SSL termination, cache static content, and improve load balancing. This helps in scaling the application horizontally by adding more server instances.

### How do you implement caching in a Node.js application?

Use caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed data.

```javascript
const redis = require("redis");
const client = redis.createClient();

app.get("/data", (req, res) => {
  const key = "some-key";
  client.get(key, (err, data) => {
    if (data) {
      return res.send(JSON.parse(data));
    } else {
      // Fetch data from the database or other source
      const fetchedData = {
        /* some data */
      };
      client.setex(key, 3600, JSON.stringify(fetchedData)); // Cache for 1 hour
      return res.send(fetchedData);
    }
  });
});
```
